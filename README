---Description---

A few people have wanted to import the parts into OPENscad but the files were not manifolded. Netfabb would not repair them correctly.

I have gone through all the parts and corrected the meshes. Afterwards I ran them through Meshlab and then through Netfabb and then back through Meshlab again.

I then made sheets for a Mendel size printer. (less than 200 x 200)
I have provided the Blend file with the three sheets laid out in case you would like to rearrange them or remove any of the parts.The zip file contains all the parts for the Lathe and transmission individually.
